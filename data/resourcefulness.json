    "historicalDevelopment": "The word 'resource' originated from Middle French 'ressource' in the 17th century, evolving from Latin 'resurgere' (to rise up). By adding the suffix '-ful' in the 18th century, it formed 'resourceful', meaning full of resources, and then '-ness' created 'resourcefulness' in the 19th century to denote the abstract quality. This reflects a shift in English from concrete resources to abstract personal traits in industrial and colonial contexts.",
