    "historicalDevelopment": "The term 'ixodiasis' evolved in the 19th century from Greek roots during the classification of arthropod-related diseases. 'Ixodes' was first used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for tick species, and the suffix '-iasis' was commonly added in medical terminology to denote infestations or diseases, as seen in words like 'elephantiasis'. Over time, it became standardized in veterinary and human medicine to describe tick-borne conditions.",
