    "historicalDevelopment": "The word 'outshout' emerged in the 19th century as a compound in English, combining 'out-' (indicating surpassing or exceeding) with 'shout' (a verb for loud vocalization). It evolved from earlier uses of 'shout' in Middle English, which denoted a cry or call, and reflects the expansion of prefixation in English to express intensity or competition. Over time, it has maintained its literal sense without significant metaphorical shifts.",
