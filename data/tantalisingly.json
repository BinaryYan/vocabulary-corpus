    ],
    "historicalDevelopment": "The word derives from the Greek mythological figure Tantalus, whose eternal torment involved being teased by unattainable desires. It entered English in the 16th century as 'tantalize' (verb), evolving into 'tantalising' as an adjective by the 17th century, and 'tantalisingly' as an adverb in the 19th century, expanding from literal mythological references to metaphorical uses in everyday language for anything alluring yet elusive.",

    "usageComplexity": "6 (out of 10, as it is context-dependent and often used in descriptive or narrative writing, demanding precise adverbial placement)",
    "learningTips": [
      "结合认知科学原理，利用视觉联想将词汇与希腊神话的Tantalus形象关联，例如想象一个永不能触及的水果的场景，以增强海马体记忆；通过间隔重复系统（Spaced Repetition Systems）复习，减少遗忘曲线的影响；并在实际语境中练习，以强化语义网络的构建。"
