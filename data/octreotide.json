    "historicalDevelopment": "The term 'octreotide' was developed in the late 20th century as a pharmaceutical name for a synthetic analog of somatostatin. Somatostatin itself was discovered in the 1970s, and octreotide was synthesized in the 1980s to create a more stable and longer-acting version. It evolved from advancements in peptide chemistry and endocrinology, reflecting the need for targeted hormone therapies.",
